# Linear Algebra Project

This project contains Python scripts for practicing **linear algebra operations** using **lists** and **NumPy arrays**, following the requirements of the ALU Machine Learning course.

All scripts are compatible with **Python 3.5** and **NumPy 1.15**, and are tested on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**. Each script is executable and follows **PEP8 style**.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement basic linear algebra operations without using advanced libraries (except where allowed), including:

- Vectors and matrices slicing
- Element-wise operations
- Matrix addition and multiplication
- Concatenation of arrays/matrices
- Transpose operations
- NumPy-specific operations and broadcasting

This helps develop a **solid understanding of linear algebra** concepts such as vectors, matrices, transpose, dot product, matrix multiplication, broadcasting, and slicing.
